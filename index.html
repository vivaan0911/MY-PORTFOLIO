        <p id="myHobbyPARA"> Football is my favorite sport. It is also a famous sport all over the world. I like football becasuse football has its own language. You don't have to speak or dress a certain way or even know the same language communicate with another football fan or a football player. By playing football, we can keep our body strong, fit and flexible, to play football is a good exercise and good for health. And that's why I love football because it's a sport made for the whole universe.
